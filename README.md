## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive sales dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard is designed to visualize and analyze a large, unaggregated dataset, providing insights into sales performance over time, by region, segment, and product category.

## Features

- **PivotTables**: Used to summarize and aggregate large datasets, enabling dynamic data analysis and reporting.
- **PivotCharts**: Visual representations of data trends and patterns, including line charts for sales over time and bar charts for regional sales comparisons.
- **Slicers**: Interactive filters that allow users to segment data by categories such as product type, region, or sales period.

## Data

The dashboard is based on a large, unaggregated dataset containing detailed sales information, including:
- Sales and profit figures by year, region, and segment
- Product categories and sub-categories
- Order counts and sales amounts over multiple years

## Visualizations

- **Sales and Profit Over Time**: A line chart illustrating the trends in sales and profit across different years.
- **Sales by Region and Segment**: A stacked bar chart displaying sales distribution across various regions (Central, East, South, West) and customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- **Count of Orders Over Time**: A line chart showing the number of orders placed each year.

## Interactive Elements

- **Category and Sub-Category Slicers**: Filters that allow users to drill down into specific product categories and sub-categories.
- **Order Date Filter**: A time slider to filter data by specific years, providing a focused view of sales performance.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Excel File**: Clone the repository and open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel or download the file manually.
2. **Interact with Slicers**: Use the slicers on the right to filter the data based on your desired criteria (e.g., Category, Sub-Category, Order Date).
3. **Analyze the Charts and Tables**: Observe how the PivotTables and PivotCharts dynamically update to reflect your selections.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Excel 2016 or later is required to use the PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers effectively.
